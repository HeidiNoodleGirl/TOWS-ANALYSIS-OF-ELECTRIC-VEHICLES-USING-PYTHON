# TOWS Analysis on Electric Vehicles using Python

This project involves the creation of a Jupyter notebook to perform a TOWS analysis and report recommended actions to senior stakeholders of a business supplying hire vehicles to tourists in QLD.

The analysis includes both internal structured data and external web data, utilizing Python libraries (e.g., requests, json, BeautifulSoup, pandas). This approach aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the company, along with the opportunities and threats it faces.

Two versions of the report are included in this repository:
- The `.ipynb` file: original notebook created in JupyterLab.
- The `.html` file: a converted HTML version generated from the above notebook.
